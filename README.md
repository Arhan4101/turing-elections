## Dhruva Sambrani

Hi! I'm Dhruva, MS18163, and I think I'd make a good candidate for this post because I am very smart and have glasses.

You can find me at [my Github](https://github.com/DhruvaSambrani) and at [my website and blog](https://dhruvasambrani.github.io/).

**My manifesto video**
<video src="./ms18163.mp4" width="320" height="240" controls>
<source src="./ms18163.mp4" type="video/mp4">
Your browser does not support the video tag, try to download the video from <a href="./ms18163.mp4">here</a>
